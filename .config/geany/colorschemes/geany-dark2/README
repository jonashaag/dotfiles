A Dark Theme for "Geany - A fast and lightweight IDE"
-----------------------------------------------------


About
-----
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent
as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it
is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the
GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.

This extention adds a dark color theme for the following file types:
- c: C files
- conf: Configuration files (.conf)
- cpp: C++ files
- css: Cascading Style Sheet files
- html: HTML files
- java: Java files
- javascript: JavaScript files
- latex: LaTeX files
- makefile: Make files
- php: PHP files
- python: Python files
- xml: XML files
- common: All other files

Requirements
------------
You need to have Geany installed.

Installation
------------
Just copy the content of the tar file to Geany's directory inside your
home path at: /home/YourUserName/.geany/filedefs/ .

Note
-----
Note that the filetypes.common included in this package, will have an
effect on how other file types which are not supported by this package
will be rendered. If this is annoying for your work, simply delete or
rename it to something else to regain the original look of Geany for
other files.

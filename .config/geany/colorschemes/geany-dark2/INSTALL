Basic Installation
==================
Just copy the content of the tar file to Geany's directory inside your
home path at: /home/YourUserName/.geany/filedefs/ .

Note
-----
Note that the filetypes.common included in this package, will have an
effect on how other file types which are not supported by this package
will be rendered. If this is annoying for your work, simply delete or
rename it to something else to regain the original look of Geany for
other files.
